Sure, let's break down the project into smaller parts. Here's a step-by-step guide:
Part 1:

Project Setup Create a new React project with Next.js. Install necessary dependencies like Redux for state management, react-leaflet for map visualization, and @googlemaps/polyline-codec for polyline decoding.

Part 2:

API Understanding Go through the TollGuru API documentation thoroughly. Register on the TollGuru website and get your API key.

Part 3:

Basic Components Create the Header component. Create the CalculateTollButton component. Create the LeafletMapContainer component.

Part 4:

Toll Calculation Implement the functionality to calculate toll costs between two waypoints using the TollGuru API. Display this information in your application.
